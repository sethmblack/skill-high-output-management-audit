# High Output Management Audit

Audit a manager's or organization's effectiveness through Andy Grove's output-based management framework. Identify leverage points, eliminate bottlenecks, and transform managerial productivity from art to engineering: "The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence."

---

## When to Use

- Manager or team is working hard but not producing results
- Unclear what a manager should actually be doing
- Organizational productivity is declining or stagnant
- Question of "how do I become more effective?"
- Team has capacity issues or bottlenecks
- Need to diagnose why an organization underperforms

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| role | Yes | The manager or organizational unit being audited |
| current_activities | Yes | How time is currently being spent |
| team_structure | No | Direct reports, organizational relationships |
| outputs | No | What the team is supposed to produce |
| pain_points | No | Specific complaints or concerns |

## Grove's High Output Management Framework

### The Fundamental Equation

> "The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence."

**Key insight:** A manager is not evaluated by their personal contribution but by what their team and influenced teams produce.

**Expanded equation:**
```
Manager's Output = Output of direct organization
                 + Output of influenced organizations
                 - Negative effects of interference
```

### Leverage: The Key to Effectiveness

Leverage is the multiplier effect of a manager's activities. High-leverage activities affect many people or affect few people significantly.

**Leverage formula:**
> Managerial Output = Sum of (Activity x Leverage of that Activity)

**High-leverage activities:**
- Training (affects many people over long time)
- Decision-making (affects many people or large resources)
- Information sharing (enables better decisions by others)
- Removing obstacles (unblocks entire teams)
- Setting clear direction (aligns all subsequent work)

**Low-leverage activities:**
- Doing work that subordinates could do
- Attending meetings without clear purpose
- Reviewing work that does not need review
- Creating reports no one reads
- Managing up instead of managing out

### Task-Relevant Maturity

There is no single best management style. The right approach depends on the subordinate's experience and capability for the specific task:

| Task-Relevant Maturity | Management Style | Communication |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Low** | Structured, task-oriented | Tell: what, when, how |
| **Medium** | Individual-oriented, two-way | Discuss: goals, context |
| **High** | Minimal involvement | Delegate: outcomes only |

**Note:** The same person may have different task-relevant maturity for different tasks.

### Everything is Process

Grove's engineering background: all work can be modeled as a production process.

**Process elements to analyze:**
- **Inputs:** What raw materials or information enter?
- **Outputs:** What is produced?
- **Limiting step:** What constrains throughput?
- **Quality control:** Where do you catch problems?
- **Variability:** What causes inconsistency?

---

## Audit Process

### Step 1: Define Outputs

What should this manager/organization produce? Be specific.

| Output | Measurement | Current Performance | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------------------| -------|
| [Output 1] | [How measured] | [Current level] | [Target level] |
| [Output 2] | | | |

**Test:** If you cannot define outputs, the role lacks clarity.

### Step 2: Map Current Activities

How does the manager currently spend time?

| Activity | Hours/Week | Category | Leverage |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|
| [Activity 1] | [#] | [Meetings/Individual/Admin/Producing] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Activity 2] | | | |

**Categories:**
- **Meetings:** Scheduled group time
- **Individual:** One-on-ones, reviews, coaching
- **Admin:** Email, reporting, coordination
- **Producing:** Personal contribution (not managing)

### Step 3: Calculate Leverage

For each activity, assess leverage:

| Activity | People Affected | Duration of Effect | Output Impact | Leverage Score |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| [Activity] | [# people] | [One-time/Ongoing/Permanent] | [Critical/Important/Nice-to-have] | [High/Med/Low] |

**High leverage indicators:**
- Affects many people
- Has lasting effects
- Impacts critical outputs
- Cannot be done by others

**Low leverage indicators:**
- Affects few people
- Effect is temporary
- Marginal output impact
- Could be delegated or eliminated

### Step 4: Identify Limiting Steps

What constrains the team's output? Where do things get stuck?

**Common limiting steps:**
- Decision-making bottlenecks (waiting for approvals)
- Information bottlenecks (waiting for data or context)
- Skill bottlenecks (lack of capability)
- Coordination bottlenecks (dependencies on other teams)
- Capacity bottlenecks (not enough people)

| Output | Limiting Step | Owner | Impact |
|--------|--------------|-------|--------|
| [Output 1] | [What constrains this] | [Who owns the constraint] | [How much throughput is lost] |

### Step 5: Evaluate Task-Relevant Maturity

For key team members, assess task-relevant maturity for their critical tasks:

| Person | Task | TRM Level | Current Style | Recommended Style |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Name] | [Key task] | [Low/Med/High] | [Current approach] | [Optimal approach] |

**Mismatches to identify:**
- High TRM person being micromanaged
- Low TRM person left without structure
- Medium TRM person without feedback loops

### Step 6: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, recommend changes:

| Category | Current State | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Activities to **ELIMINATE** | [Low leverage activities] | Stop doing | Free [X] hours |
| Activities to **DELEGATE** | [Could be done by others] | Assign to | Free [X] hours |
| Activities to **ADD** | [Missing high-leverage] | Start doing | Improve [output] |
| Limiting steps to **REMOVE** | [Bottlenecks] | [Action] | Increase throughput |
| TRM **ADJUSTMENTS** | [Mismatches] | [Style change] | Improve effectiveness |

## Constraints

- Do not apply to strategic problems (use strategic-inflection-point-diagnosis)
- Recognize that some activities have hidden leverage (culture building, relationship development)
- Acknowledge organizational constraints that prevent ideal changes
- Task-relevant maturity is task-specific, not person-general
- Output measurement must be meaningful, not vanity metrics

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cannot define outputs | Flag as critical problem; cannot audit effectiveness without defined outcomes |
| No time data available | Estimate based on described activities; recommend time tracking |
| Resistance to delegation | Identify whether skill gap, trust gap, or control issue |
| All activities seem necessary | Apply stricter leverage test; something must be lower leverage |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a engineering manager with 8 direct reports. I'm in meetings all day, I never have time to code anymore, and I feel like I'm not adding value. My team ships but I'm not sure if I'm actually helping."

**Output:**

## High Output Management Audit: Engineering Manager (8 Direct Reports)

### Output Definition

| Output | Measurement | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|-----|
| Team shipping velocity | Features/sprint | "Ships" | Measurable | Unknown |
| Team member growth | Promotions, skills | Unknown | 1+ per year | Unknown |
| Technical decisions | Unblocked decisions | Unknown | <24hr turnaround | Unknown |
| Cross-team influence | Projects enabled | Unknown | Measurable | Unknown |

**Primary output:** Team shipping velocity with quality (features delivered that work and matter)

### Activity Analysis

**Likely time allocation (8 direct reports):**
- 1:1s: 4 hours/week (30 min each)
- Team meetings: 2-4 hours/week
- Cross-functional meetings: 8-12 hours/week (likely bloated)
- Admin/coordination: 4-6 hours/week
- Personal coding: 0-2 hours/week
- Strategic/planning: 2-4 hours/week

**Initial assessment:** Cross-functional meetings are likely consuming disproportionate time relative to their leverage.

### High-Leverage Activities (PRESERVE/EXPAND)

| Activity | Why High Leverage | Recommendation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| 1:1s with reports | Direct development of 8 people | Preserve - this is core |
| Unblocking decisions | Removes constraints for entire team | Expand if currently inadequate |
| Hiring/firing decisions | Team quality affects all output | Preserve time for this |
| Architecture guidance | Affects technical trajectory | Ensure adequate time |

### Low-Leverage Activities (ELIMINATE/DELEGATE)

| Activity | Why Low Leverage | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Coding | Manager of 8 should manage, not code | Eliminate - your leverage is through others |
| Status update meetings | Information could flow async | Reduce or make async |
| Meetings where you're not needed | Presence without contribution | Decline or send delegate |
| Detailed code review | Team leads can handle | Delegate - review architecture, not code |

### Limiting Steps

| Output | Limiting Step | Root Cause | Removal Action |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Shipping velocity | Decision latency | Manager unavailable due to meetings | Protected decision hours |
| Team growth | No development focus | Time consumed by coordination | Dedicated development conversations |

**Primary bottleneck:** Calendar is full of coordination meetings, leaving no time for the high-leverage work of developing people and making decisions.

### Task-Relevant Maturity Assessment

| Team Member | Critical Task | TRM | Style Needed | Action |
|-------------|---------------|-----|--------------|--------|
| Senior engineers | Technical decisions | High | Delegate | Stop reviewing their code |
| Mid-level engineers | Feature delivery | Medium | Discuss | Ensure adequate 1:1 depth |
| Junior engineers | Technical skills | Low | Tell (structured) | Ensure they get directed guidance |

### Recommendations Summary

**Immediate actions (this week):**
1. Audit your calendar - identify 5 recurring meetings you can decline or delegate
2. Stop coding - your output is your team's output, not your personal contribution

**Short-term changes (this month):**
1. Block "office hours" for quick unblocking decisions (2 hours/week)
2. Move status updates to async (Slack/written) to reclaim meeting time
3. Identify which cross-functional meetings truly need you vs. a delegate

**Structural changes (this quarter):**
1. Develop team leads who can represent you in routine meetings
2. Create clear decision authority matrix so team can self-unblock
3. Restructure 1:1s around development, not status

### Expected Output Improvement

If recommendations implemented:
- Current: Feeling ineffective, no time for high-leverage work
- Expected: 6-8 hours/week reclaimed for development and decision-making
- Impact: Faster team unblocking, better team member growth, clearer value-add

### Grove Principle Applied

> "The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence."

You are not supposed to code. You are supposed to ensure your team of 8 people codes effectively. Every hour you spend coding is an hour you are not spending making your team 1% more effective - and 1% of 8 people is worth more than 100% of your personal coding time.

The fact that you "feel like you're not adding value" while your team ships is a cognitive distortion. Your value is their shipping. Stop measuring yourself by personal contribution.
